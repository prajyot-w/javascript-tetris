# Javascript Tetris

 This is a hobby project where I created a simple tetris game using vanilla javascript.
 To play the game, just clone the project and open index.html file in Google Chrome.
 I have not tested the game in all browser's as I have developed it on Google Chrome.
 
 I would love to receive any suggestions / improvements.
